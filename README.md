A basic landing page that includes the header and footer and contains some information about the T-shirt brand, where you can see the different colors of the T-shirts.
On this landing page, I used HTML, CSS, and JS, and I used JavaScript Local Storage, so that when you reload the page or close it and open it again, the page still retains the last T-shirt color you chose.
